# SRAM

**AIM:** Designing a Synchronous Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) . 
A memory system that operates in synchronization with a clock signal, allowing reliable and efficient storage and retrieval of data. 
The objective is to ensure that the read and write operations happen at predefined clock cycles, providing predictable and stable memory access times, which is crucial for use in high-speed digital circuits. 

**Data Storage:** To store a defined number of data words 

**Synchronous Operation:** To ensure all read and write operations are controlled by a clock signal (clk), thereby enabling synchronization with other system components. 

**Write Control:** To write data into the memory when the Write Enable (Wr) signal is active, ensuring data is stored at the correct address. 

**Read Control:** To read data from the memory when the Wr signal is inactive, providing the stored data from the specified address. 

**Reliable Timing:** To achieve predictable timing for both reading and writing operations, reducing complexity in timing analysis and integration into larger systems.
